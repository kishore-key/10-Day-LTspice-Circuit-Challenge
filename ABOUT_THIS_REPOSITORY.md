# âš¡ 10 Days LTspice Circuit Challenge + Extras

Hi! Iâ€™m an Electronics and Communication Engineering student from **SSN College of Engineering**,  
passionate about circuit design and a huge fan of simulation tools like **LTspice**.  
This repo is the result of my 10-day analog circuit simulation challenge â€” and a few bonus circuits too!

Each day focuses on building a unique analog circuit, simulated and tested on LTspice.  
All `.asc` files are included â€” feel free to explore, modify, and simulate them yourself!
